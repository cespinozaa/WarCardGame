# WarCardGame

This is a simple card game of war in which the user plays against the computer. Cards are dealt with each player receiving half of the deck. Cards are revealed one by one and the person with the highest card wins that round and gets to keep both cards. The game goes on for an eternity... until either the user or the computer wins all the cards of the deck. This project was an assignment by UNCG's CSC339 Concepts of Programming Languages course.
